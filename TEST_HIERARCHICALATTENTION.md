# Introduction

**Imagine you work for a company** that sells cameras and you would like to find out what customers think about the latest release. Ratings might not be enough since users tend to rate products differently. One might consider a product they rates with 3 out of 5 stars very good, others always give full stars even if they dislike a few aspects. Text classification can give a clue, whether ratings actually describe the overall opinion towards the product. Additionally, the number of possibilities to get opinions from is rising: Nowadays, you will be able to find a vast amount of reviews on your product or general opinion sharing from users on various platforms, such as facebook, twitter, instagram, or blogposts. As you can see, the number of platforms that need to be operated is quite big and therefore also the amount of comments or reviews. So, how can you deal with all of this textual data and gain knowledge from it?

# Text Classification

**Evaluating all of the textual data manually** is very time consuming and strenuous. A more efficient way to extract important information from it is text classification. <br>
Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing. The goal is to assign unstructured documents (e.g. reviews, emails, posts, website contents etc.) to classes, that is, to classify them. Such classes can be review scores like star ratings, spam or topic labeling. <br>
Essentially, text classification can be used whenever there are certain tags to map to a large amount of textual data. To learn the how to classify, we need to build classifiers which are obtained from labeled examples. In this way, the process of examining information becomes automated and thus simpler.

# Applications

Text classification finds a variety of application possibilities due to the large amount of data which can be interpreted.

### Topic Labeling

By topic labeling every kind of assigning text to topics or categories is meant. This can also include unstructured texts. The main goal is to extract generic tags. Topic labeling is the most important and widest used application of text classification. It has a few sub applications.

**Marketing**: The 'new' marketing has moved from search engines to social media platforms where real communication between brands and users take place. Users don not only review products but also discuss them with other users. With text classification, businesses can classify those products which have great consideration. Based on this, trends and customer types are examined.

**Reviews**: With text classification businesses can easily find aspects on which customers disagree with their services or products. They do not have to go through low rating reviews by themselves but can detect categories in which their product did or did not satisfy.  

**Tagging content**: Platforms like blogs live from publications of many people or pool products from other websites. So, if these are not tagged thoroughly in the first place, there might be the need to tag these texts or products in order to simplify navigation through the website. User experience is improved by this application too. In addition, good classified and tagged websites are more likely to appear in search engines like Google. <br>
Mentioning Google: If you're using gmail, your mails are already automated filtered and labeled by Google's text classification algorithms.

### Other Applications

Another application is **sentiment analysis**. Imagine again how differently customers might rate a product. Someone could be disappointed about one single feature that they rate it low although they liked the overall product. Or ratings might be low due to bad customer service whilst the product itself is satisfying. Text classification helps to identify those criteria.
Now, sentiment analysis predicts the sentiment towards a specific characteristic on base of text classification. This not only finds economic application but especially in sentiment analysis for social and political debates.

Text classification is already used for simpler applications like **filtering spam**. Also, a team of Google invented a method called Smart Replies in 2016. This method takes emails as inputs, identifies the sentiment or topic of the mailed text and automatically generates short, complete responses.  

# Literature Review
## How do different methods perform in text classification problems?
**For our implementation of text classification**, we have applied a hierarchical attention network, a classification method from Yang and others from 2016. The reason they developed it, although there are already well working neural networks for text classification, is because they wanted to pay attention to certain characteristics of document structures which have not been considered previously. <br>
But before going deeper into this, let's have a look at what others did:

The basics of all text classification problems lie in so-called Information Retrieval (IR) methods which started to be developed in the early 1970s. These first methods were unsupervised, that is, they try to find information from a given text document without classifying it or assigning labels to it in any kind. <br>
Here you can see the most important steps in unsupervised text classification:

With the improvement of the user-friendliness and related spread of internet usage, automated classification of growing numbers of data became important. Several supervised respectively semi-supervised methods (where the class information are learned from labeled data) are shown in the next table. <br>
Since we use a neural network, the comparison with other neural networks is prior for us. Of course, there are several different implementations of convolutional and recurrent neural networks, below are only mentioned the most 'innovative'.

# Text Classification with Hierarchical Attention Network

Contrary to the most text classification implementations, HAN also considers the hierarchical structure of documents (document - sentences - words) and includes an attention mechanism that's able to find the most important words and sentences given the whole contexts, whereas other methods only return importance weights resulting from previous words. <br>
Summarizing, HAN tries to find a solution to these problems, previous works did not consider:
* Not every word in a sentence and every sentence in a document is equally important to extract the main information from the document.
* To extract the main information in changing contexts, it is not enough to work with the single information of each word, but to get the context of all sentences and word interactions.

In this way, HAN performs better in predicting the class of a given document. <br>
To start from scratch, have a look at this example:
<center>
 <img width="50%" src="img/reviewyelp.png">
 Yang et al. 2016
</center>

<br>
Here we have a review from yelp that consists of five sentences. The highlighted sentences in red deliver stronger meaning compared to the others and inside, the words *delicious* and *amazing* contribute the most in attributing the positive attitude contained in this review. HAN predicts pretty well the most relevant information as it assorts with what we would intuitively gain from this review. <br>

## Architecture of Hierarchical Attention Network

**This is how the architecture** of HAN looks like:
<center>
 <img width="60%" src="img/han_architecture.jpg">
 Yang et al. 2016
</center>

First, the network considers the hierarchical structure of documents by constructing a document representation by building representations of sentences and then aggregating those into a document representation. <br>
**Sentence representations** are built by encoding the word of a sentence firstly and apply the attention mechanism on them secondly resulting in a *sentence vector*. <br>
**Document representation** is built in the same way, only having the sentence vector of each sentence of the document as input. <br>

Now, have a different view on the architecture of the model to understand how it works. <br>
The same algorithms are applied two times: First on word level and afterwards on sentence level. <br>
The model consists of
* the encoder, which returns relevant contexts, and
* the attention mechanism, which computes importance weights of these contexts as one vector.

### Word Level

<img width="100%" src="img/han_word.png">

* As input we have structured tokens **w_it**, that is word i per sentence t. We do not keep all words in a sentence. Learn more about that in section [data preprocessing](data-preprocessing).
* Since the model is not able to process plain text of data type *string*, the tokens run through an Embedding layer which 'assigns' multidimensional vectors **W_e*w_ij** to each token. In this way, words are represented numerically as **x_it** as a projection of the word in a continuous vector space. <br>
	There are several embedding algorithms; the most popular are [word2vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) and [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). It is also possible to use pre-trained word embedding, so you can accelerate your model training. <br>
  <center>
  <img width="21%" src="img/x_it.JPG">
  </center>

#### Word Encoder

* These vectorized tokens are the inputs for the next layer. Yang et al. use a Gated Recurrent Network (GRU) as encoding mechanism. As a short reminder: In a RNN, states are 'remembered' to ensure we can predict words depending on previous words. GRU has a so-called 'hidden state' which can be understood as a memory cell to transfer information. Two gates decide about whether to keep or forget information and with this knowledge, to update the information that should be kept. If you are interested in learning more about GRU, have a look at this nice [blog post](https://isaacchanghau.github.io/post/lstm-gru-formula/). <br>
	The purpose of this layer is to extract relevant contexts of every sentence. We call these contexts *annotations* per word. <br>
	Note that in this model, *bidirectional* GRU is applied to get annotations of words by summarizing information from both directions resulting in a summarized variable **h_it**.  <br>
  <center>
  <img width="25%" src="img/h_it.JPG">
  </center>

#### Word Attention

* Those annotations h_it build the base for the attention mechanism which starts with another hidden layer, a one-layer Multilayer Perceptron. Goal is to let the model learn through training with randomly initialized weights and biases. Those 'improved' annotations are then represented by **u_it**. Furthermore, this layer ensures that the network does not falter with a tanh function. This function 'corrects' input values to being between -1 and 1 and also maps zeros to near-zeros. <br>
  <center>
  <img width="25%" src="img/u_it.JPG">
  </center>
* Our new annotations are again multiplied with an outside trainable context vector **u_w** and normalized to an importance weight per word **alpha_it** by softmax function. <br>
  <center>
  <img width="19%" src="img/alpha_it.JPG">
  </center>
* The sum of these importance weights concatenated with the previously calculated context annotations is called sentence vector **s_i** <br>
  <center>
  <img width="15%" src="img/s_i.JPG">
  </center>

### Sentence Level

<img width="100%" src="img/han_sent.png">

* Then the whole network is run on sentence level with basically the same procedure as on word level. Of course, there is no embedding layer as we already get sentence vectors **s_i** from word level as input. In addition, now we focus on the actual sentence i.
* Trainable weights and biases are again outside randomly initialized.
* The final output is a document vector **v** which can be used as features for document classification.
* Find all formula for sentence level below.

## Implementation

### Import libraries

As the package [Keras](https://keras.io/) is 'a high-level neural networks API' extremely useful for deep learning problems, we recommend to install it in an own python environment.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kraenkem/dee626bb58952d918c043dabc127db51.js?file=libraries.ipynb"></script>

### Data Preprocessing

To demonstrate how to apply HAN we use a part of Amazon reviews for Electronic data which are public available [here](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/). This data set consists of nearly 1.7 million reviews. As the model learns through training it is highly important to have data sets with a large number of observations. Nevertheless, a million reviews would take us **days** to train on, so we set the number of reviews to keep equal to 100,000. <br>
We combine the review columns to one column to consider them together in the model and keep only the necessary columns.

=============script first_steps

**Words have to be lemmatized** to ensure that not every single typo or related term is handled by itself. Additionally, so-called stop words are filtered out. In our case, that is mainly prepositions like *as* or *to* that do not contribute to the meaning of the text. Have a look at function **cleanString**.

=================scr clean_string

**After that we can tokenize** the given sentences. We set the maximum number of words to keep equal to 200,000.

================scr tokenization

**For vectorization of our tokens** we use one of GloVe's pretrained embedding dictionaries with 100 dimensions, that is one word is represented by 100 values in a matrix. As mentioned [before](#word-level), this accelerates our training. We match our tokens with the pretrained dictionary and filter out words that appear rarely (mostly due to spelling mistakes). As you can see, reviewers for our chosen products do not pay attention to correct spelling. Unfortunately, we therefore can only remain 20,056 words to proceed. This will influence performance of our model. But we will come to this later.

============ scr embedding

For a better comprehension of what those embeddings mean, have a closer a look at an example sentence and a single token. *Great* is described by 100 values in vector spaces computed by for instance nearest neighbors.

=============== display ----> in einem script stück
===============0 scr example embedding_matrix

Now, we can already define our first layer with Keras's *Embedding*:

================= scr embedding_layer

In a last step of data preprocessing, we want to set a train, validation and test data set. For that we define a function **split_df** which ensures that all sets are balanced hence they have the same ratio for each class as the full data set. Without this predefined grouping by star rating. it could happen that the model only trains on the most occurring rating.

================ scr split_df
================= scr histogram full and train set

### Attention Mechanism

Before we can concatenate the layers of the network in Keras, we need to build the attention mechanism. Keras has a class '[Writing your own Keras layer](https://keras.io/layers/writing-your-own-keras-layers/)'. Here you are given some useful functions to implement attention. For better understanding, again have a look at the modeled attention mechanism.

======================= scr attlayer

<img src="img/only_att.png" width="88%">

The figure shows attention on word level as well as the class **AttentionLayer**, however, the layer is applied successively on first word and then sentence level.
* **init** initializes variables from a uniform distribution. Also, we set *supports_masking = True* because the network needs fixed input lengths. If some inputs are shorter than maximum input length a mask will be created initialized with 0. Then the mask will be 'filled up' with 1 to positions where the input has values in. This is further defined in the next functions.
* **build** defines the weights. We set *len(input_shape) == 3* as we get a 3d tensor from the previous layers.
* **call** builds the attention mechanism itself. As you can see, we have h_it, the context annotations, as input and get the sum of importance weights, hence sentence vector s_i, as output. In between, the current variable is reduced by the last dimension and expanded again because masking needs a binary tensor.

### Model

Congrats, you made it through a huge mass of theoretical input. Now, let's finally see how the model performs. Some last little hints:
* The layers have to be combined on word and sentence level.
* *TimeDistributed* applies all word level layers on each sentence.
* We want to have an output dimensionality of GRU equal to 50, because running it forwards and backwards returns 100 dimensions - which is the dimensionality of our inputs.
* *Dropout* is a regularizer to prevent overfitting by turning off a number of neurons in every layer - 0.5 gets a high variance, but you can play around with this as well as with other parameters.

=============================scr model

**Dense** implements a last layer for actual document classification. The document vector runs again with outside weights and biases through a softmax function. Softmax makes the output readable by giving the probability of belonging to a predefined class. We end up with 505 dense parameters (5 units x 100 dimensions + 5 biases).

**We train** the model throughout a relatively small number of epochs of 7 since our input data are already pre-trained and will overfit after too much epochs, also because the batch size of 32 works with a large number of inputs due to our large data set. Note that you have to train reviews **x** against labels **y** (in this case the 5-star ratings).

================00scr history
======================= scr evaluation
========================= scr plots

**Model evaluation** is with 69 % quite high how a comparison with the results from Yang et al. themselves as well as from others shows (see table below).
**Also history plots** show that the training data set perform pretty well. Still, this is unfortunately not supported by the validation data set. This might be because of the small number of words we could proceed after the embedding layer which filtered out almost 70 % of all tokens due to misspelling. This might be improved with an even smaller batch and epoch size, or with a better, less mistaken data set.

# Take Away

#### What is relevant to remember about text classification with hierarchical attention network?

* hierarchical structure of documents (document - sentence - word)
* attention on contexts of sentences and words
* by considering changing contexts, HAN performs better for classification problems
